# Brest-Cancer-Prediction
I have done this project as a part of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Live Project building session held on 01st and 02nd February 2021 by LetsUpgrade by Dr Darshan ingle sir
In this Project, implemented 4 different machine learning algorithms namely
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Classifier

After, implementing all the fout algorithms, I have got the same accuracy for Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier.
